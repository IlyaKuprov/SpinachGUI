In order to make changes in the SpinXML:

1. Rename the older spinxml_schema.h & spinxml_schema_reference_frame.h 
   in order to use them later;

2. Change the XSD files using Liquid XML or something like that;

3. Import it in visual studio in order to autogenerate the .h code;

4. After that, delete the .xsd files from the project inside the visual studio, 
   so only the .h files to exist. This in order to avoid continuous auto-generation
   of the code.

5. Open the older version files and make diff(using WinMerge) with the new files 
   to see the differences. The differences that are not created by the changes you
   made you must copy them to the new files.
